- Constructed the back-end API with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, enabling secure data storage and retrieval.
- Integrated JSON Web Tokens for user authentication and authorization, guaranteeing data security.
- Deployed the application to render.com for the back-end and netlify for the front-end, ensuring worldwide accessibility.

## Technologies Used

- Front-End : React.js, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, TailwindCSS
- Back-End : Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, JSON Web Tokens
- Deployment : render.com for backend and netlify for frontend

## How to Setup

1. Clone github repo
2. Install all dependencies using `npm install` in the the backend, frontend, and main source folders.
3. Take out links to onrender.com or netlify Ex: Convert `https://mern-exercise-tracker-wxyg.onrender.com/api/exercises` to just `/api/exercises` in the fetch methods.
4. Replace the `MONGO_URI` with your own mongodb deployment link and `SECRET` with your own key.
5. In the backend folder run `npm run dev` and then in the frontend folder run `npm start` to start the react app.
6. Now the app should run on your local computer
